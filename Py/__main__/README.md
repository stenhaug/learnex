Highest level is 

    if __name__ == "__main__"
    
allows you to put code in there that will execute when you call it directly

and then other code is run only when you import

===

When running code directly 
(this is either just repl from R or from terminal with python3 Py/ifnameequalsmain/file_one.py)

    __name__ = "__main__"
    
When importing from another file then

    __name__ = "file_two"

(or whatever the name of the module is)
